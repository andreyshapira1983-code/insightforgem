                <p><strong>Important Notice:</strong> The information provided by Star Galaxy is for general informational purposes only. It is not intended as legal, financial, or professional advice. Always consult with qualified professionals before making decisions based on our analysis.</p>

            <h2>1. No Professional Advice</h2>
            <p>Star Galaxy provides an automated analysis of business ideas using artificial intelligence. Our analysis is not a substitute for professional advice from qualified experts in business, law, finance, or other relevant fields. You should consult with appropriate professionals before taking any action based on our analysis.</p>
            
            <h2>2. Intellectual Property Considerations</h2>
            <p>Different countries have different laws regarding intellectual property protection. Our analysis does not guarantee that an idea is free from existing patents, trademarks, or copyrights. We strongly recommend conducting proper intellectual property searches in relevant jurisdictions before pursuing any business idea.</p>
            
            <h3>2.1 Patent Considerations by Country</h3>
            <p>Patent laws vary significantly across jurisdictions. Here are some key differences to be aware of:</p>
            
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Country/Region</th>
                    <th>Key Patent Considerations</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>United States</td>
                    <td>First-to-file system; software and business methods may be patentable under certain conditions</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>European Union</td>
                    <td>First-to-file system; stricter requirements for software and business method patents</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>China</td>
                    <td>First-to-file system; increasing protection for software patents</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Russia</td>
                    <td>First-to-file system; software generally protected by copyright rather than patents</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Japan</td>
                    <td>First-to-file system; software patentable if it has technical characteristics</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            
            <h2>3. Accuracy Limitations</h2>
            <p>While we strive to provide accurate and useful information, our analysis has inherent limitations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Our AI models are based on available data and may not account for recent market changes</li>
                <li>The analysis is only as good as the information provided in your idea description</li>
                <li>Market conditions can change rapidly, affecting the viability of business ideas</li>
                <li>Local regulations and market conditions may vary significantly from global trends</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>4. No Guarantee of Success</h2>
            <p>A positive analysis from Star Galaxy does not guarantee the success of your business idea. Many factors beyond our analysis contribute to the success or failure of a business venture, including execution, market timing, funding, competition, and other external factors.</p>
            
            <h2>5. Jurisdictional Differences</h2>
            <p>Business regulations, patent laws, and intellectual property protections vary significantly between countries. What may be permissible in one jurisdiction may be restricted or regulated differently in another. You are responsible for ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where you intend to operate.</p>
            
            <h2>6. No Confidentiality Guarantee</h2>
            <p>While we implement security measures to protect your information, we cannot guarantee absolute confidentiality of ideas submitted through our platform. For highly sensitive or valuable ideas, consider obtaining legal protection (such as patents or NDAs) before sharing details publicly or through our service.</p>
            
            <h2>7. Third-Party Links</h2>
            <p>Our service may contain links to third-party websites or resources. We are not responsible for the content, accuracy, or practices of these third-party sites and resources.</p>
            
            <h2>8. Changes to This Disclaimer</h2>
            <p>We may update this Legal Disclaimer from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Disclaimer on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.</p>
